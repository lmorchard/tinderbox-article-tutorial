I've long used outlines and mindmaps to get thoughts and out of my head and onto paper and screens. So, it's pretty inevitable that I'd eventually be attracted to <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>.</p><p>But, the thing is, <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> is a complex <em>technology</em>. Note that I didn't say <em>application</em> or <em>utility</em>: <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> isn't a sleek little productivity app you can pick up for $20 or less—and if you approach it from that mindset both the price and user interface will baffle you.</p><p>No, <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> is more like a hyperdimensional spreadsheet or a personal <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>. <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> is a platform for capturing your thoughts and wrapping them in a scaffold of machine intelligence. The learning curve follows a crazy-steep <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid function</a>. But, the complexity is there for a reason. This isn't a commuter vehicle; this is a fully-articulated piece of <a href="http://bit.ly/cBJBpX">construction-site heavy machinery</a> for your brain.</p><p>And, as such, you'll probably require a bit of training before you can get productive. So, apropos of <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/03/10/pondering-the-cobwebs">my notion of writing for myself</a>, I thought I might throw together a bit of a tutorial on some things in <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> that have all finally come together for me. If I do this right, it'll be a tutorial I wish I'd had a few years ago.</p>			<section id="sect-2">	<h2>Writing an article in Tinderbox</h2>	<p>This is going to be a tutorial about writing an article with <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> for publication as HTML. In fact, this tutorial is an article written using Tinderbox, so it'll serve as its own example. You're reading the HTML export now, and the complete <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> source document can be <a href="http://github.com/lmorchard/tinderbox-article">found here on GitHub</a>. I'll be building things up incrementally throughout this tutorial, tracking the actual process I went through along the way. Following along with the final product may help you—though building your own may help more.</p>	<section id="sect-3">	<h3>Outline the article's sections</h3>	<p>The first thing to do is to create a new document, which opens up as an Outline View by default.  Hit return to create your first <em>note</em>, and type the title "Creating an HTML5 Article with Tinderbox":<img src="img/010-outline.png" alt="010-outline" title="A new outline" /></p><p>Now, if you hit SHIFT-Return, you'll create a child note under the first one. Type the title of your second note, "Outline your article's sections".  After that, hit Return, and you can start typing the title of the next note.  Your outline is now well under way:<img src="img/020-outline-2.png" alt="020-outline-2" title="An outline in progress" /></p><p>Continue like this, sketching out the structure of what you plan to write. You can drag notes around to rearrange them, delete them, do whatever you like with the outline. Note that <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> offers many further tools for capturing and visualizing your thoughts, but we'll stick with the Outline View for now.</p>	</section><section id="sect-4">	<h3>Write the article's text in notes</h3>	<p>Once you've got an outline for your article in good shape, it's time to start writing the text of the article itself. Really, you can bounce back and forth between outlining and writing prose—Tinderbox doesn't impose a process—but this is a good time to introduce the latter.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>, notes have many attributes. So far, you've seen the <code>$Name</code> attribute in use as the titles of outline nodes. Well, notes can also contain body text. To see what I mean, click on a note to select it—say the root note of your outline—and hit the spacebar. Here's what the body text looks like for the root node of this tutorial:<img src="img/021-note-text.png" alt="021-note-text" title="Note body text editor" /></p><p>You can click on any note in the outline and call up a body text editor with the spacebar. By using this editor, you can work on writing the actual content of your article.</p><p>But, clicking on each note and hitting the spacebar can get tedious after awhile. <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> offers another View to make editing the text easier across a complex document. Select <code>View &gt; New Explorer View</code> from the menu, and you'll see something like this window:<img src="img/025-explorer-view.png" alt="025-explorer-view" title="New Explorer view" /></p><p>The Explorer View is a split window combining both a note text editor with another view type. By default, this will show your outline. Here, you can click on the title of a note, and its text appears in the editor. This should make it easier to jump back and forth between sections, and even perform some tweaks to the outline itself.</p>	</section></section><section id="sect-5">	<h2>Exporting the article as HTML</h2>	<p>Now, say you're done composing the content of your article. You've gotten the outline structured to your satisfaction, and you've written everything you want for a first draft. At this point, you'd like to get the thing exported as HTML to publish somewhere on the web.</p><p>This is where the more advanced features of <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>'s HTML export templates come into play.</p>	<section id="sect-6">	<h3>Create an "Internals" note to contain non-exportable utility notes</h3>	<p>Now, things start to get interesting. First, in order to keep things clean, you're going to create a new note to contain the export machinery you'll soon need. </p><p>Select the root note of your article.  But, rather than just hitting return to create a new outline item, hit Cmd-K to summon the full Create Note dialog window:<img src="img/050-internals.png" alt="050-internals" title="Creating the internals note" /></p><p>In this dialog, you can control quite a number of different attributes and options. But, ignore most of them for now. Just type the name "Internals" and, for good measure, check the "Separator" box. This will create a new note like the following:<img src="img/060-internals.png" alt="060-internals" title="The internals note in the outline" /></p><p>Notice I got a little ahead of things in the screenshot above: The next thing you want to do is add two notes as children under "Internals", respectively named Prototypes and Templates.</p>	</section><section id="sect-12">	<h3>Use prototypes to augment notes with common details</h3>		<section id="sect-13">	<h4>Create a Prototype named *article</h4>		<section id="sect-14">	<h5>Assign a "web" badge</h5>		</section></section><section id="sect-15">	<h4>Edit the article note and use the *article prototype</h4>		</section><section id="sect-16">	<h4>Create a Prototype named *section</h4>		<section id="sect-17">	<h5>Assign a "next" badge</h5>		</section></section><section id="sect-18">	<h4>Select multiple section notes and use the Quickstamp tool to assign the *section prototype to all</h4>		</section><section id="sect-19">	<h4>Assign OnAdd rules to prototypes to auto-create *section notes.</h4>		</section></section><section id="sect-20">	<h3>Build templates for HTML export</h3>		<section id="sect-21">	<h4>Create a *template prototype</h4>		</section><section id="sect-22">	<h4>Create article.html</h4>		<section id="sect-23">	<h5>Select the *article prototype and open a New HTML View</h5>		</section><section id="sect-24">	<h5>Select the article.html template</h5>		</section></section><section id="sect-25">	<h4>Create section.html</h4>		<section id="sect-26">	<h5>Select the *section prototype and open a New HTML View</h5>		</section><section id="sect-27">	<h5>Select the section.html template</h5>		</section></section><section id="sect-40">	<h4>Restrict exported notes by changing HTMLDontExport default to true</h4>		<section id="sect-41">	<h5>Remember to set HTMLDontExport to true on *article and *section prototypes</h5>		</section></section><section id="sect-28">	<h4>Open a new HTML View on the root article note and hit update</h4>		</section></section><section id="sect-29">	<h3>Refine the HTML export templates</h3>		<section id="sect-30">	<h4>Add the $Id sequence attribute and include unique section IDs</h4>		</section><section id="sect-31">	<h4>Use runCommand() to filter text through Markdown</h4>		</section></section></section>		</article>		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"></script>	</body></html>
